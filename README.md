CR_PromoteExpressionToParameter
===============================
This plugin provides a new "Promote (Expression) To Parameter" Refactoring

It produces the same effect as using "**Introduce Local**" followed by "**Promote to Parameter**"

So all it really does is save you a a few keystrokes/ mouse movements. but that's ok, since making you more efficient is what CodeRush and the DXCore are all about.

Usage
====
Select any expression, on which you would normally be able to apply "**Introduce Local**" and you should see the additional option of "**Declare Parameter**" in the code section of the CodeRush SmartTagMenu
